					<h4>Alien Invaders Augmented Reality Game</h4>

						<div class="details">CSE 310A: Augmented Reality Seminar - Spring 2012</div>
						<p>This project is an augmented reality tower defense game made using <a href="http://www.processing.org/">Processing</a>. The user must have a webcam and Processing to play. The player uses a red marker to move a flame around the screen to destroy invading aliens before they attack one of three towers.</p>

					<h4>Google Trends Data Structure</h4>
					<div class="contentarea">
						<div class="details">CSE 274: Data Abstraction and Data Structures - Spring 2012</div>
						<p>
							The purpose of this project was to develop a data structure that could be used in a similar context as Google Trends. The program that the data structure is used with goes through a text file and inputs each word into the data structure. The data structure must store all of these words.
						</p>	
						<p>
							The data structure needed to be able to do four functions:
							</p><ul>
								<li>increaseCount - adds either a new word to the data structure or, if the word is already present, increases the number of occurences of the word.</li>
								<li>getCount - returns the current count for a given term</li>
								<li>getNthPopular - returns the term that is the Nth most occuring word stored in the data structure</li>
								<li>numEntries - returns the number of terms that are currently stored in the data structure</li>
							</ul>
						<p></p>
						<p>
							Each student is ranked for each individual function. Nearly every student tied on getCount and numEntries. I placed first for getNthPopular by sacrificing some time for increaseCount.						
						</p>
						<p>
							This data structure implementation stores the terms in a hash table that uses chaining for collision resolution. In addition, each term also keeps track of the term that is 1 position more popular and 1 position less popular. Each time increaseCount is called the term is checked to see if it should move forward in popularity by comparing it to the next more popular term. This method proved very effective at keeping both getNthPopular and increaseCount relatively fast, until it came time to sort ties alphabetically. At this point, increaseCount became incredibly slow, but getNthPopular was so fast that this method was kept.

					<h4>Krencrypt Password Manager</h4>
					<div class="contentarea">
						<div class="details">Free time - Spring 2012</div>
						<img src="./cs_projects_files/krencrypt_screenshot1.png" width="225" class="right" alt="Screenshot">
						<p>This project was done for the purpose of managing my own personal passwords. I had been reading quite a bit about information security and entropy at the time and wanted a way to save secure passwords. Rather than have a file containing all of the passwords that could possibly stolen, I decided to make a program that would consistently generate unique passwords.</p>
						<p>The program began as a simple command line interface in which the user would provide 3 parameters: the username, the service name, and a master password.  Given the same three inputs, the program would always generate the same password, thus allowing the user to only remember the username and a single password.  The program quickly grew into a GUI that would accept a key file that can be stored on a hard drive or flash drive, rather than remembering a simple passphrase.</p>
